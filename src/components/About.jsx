    <br/>
    <p className=' text-light'>I solve problems in creative ways. At JEC, where I am completing my senior year in the College of Engineering, I have learned the importance of applying classical strategies to modern-day projects.</p><p className=' text-light'>

I started learning to code when I was a teenager, though it was always more of a hobby than a career focus. During starting days of my Bachelor's, and continuing to pursue that hobby, I realized software engineering was the right field for me.</p><p className=' text-light'>

Since then I worked as an Intern in Xtreme Media as a Technical Support Intern, Agile Trainee at Xtransmatrics Consulting, production Trainee at SMGULP.</p><p className=' text-light'>

I’m familiar with a variety of programming languages, including C, C++, Javascript, react js, HTML, and CSS, and skills like Operating systems, Agile methodology, Scrum Framework, and Computer Networks but I’m always adding new skills to my repertoire.</p>
